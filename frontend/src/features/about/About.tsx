            offer the most competitive prices while also offering a great

            unwanted toys that get sent to landfill each year in the Israel. We
            know we can all do better to give a new life to your unwanted toys,
            toy-exchange offers you a hassle free way to sell your toys to us,

            Our Mission
          </h3>
          <p className="font-sans text-lg">
            When we receive your unwanted toys and have paid you for them, itâ€™s
            up to us to find them a new home where they can be used again. We do
            this by checking the condition and repairing to bring your toys back
            to life so that they are ready to be re-sold. We then catalog and
            store these items in our facility. Some toys are sold directly by
            ourselves on third party sites, some are held as spares or repairs.
            If we have excess items or items that have not sold, we sell them in
            bulk, donate to local charities or as a last resort responsibly
            recycle them.

              Eco-friendly Recycling
            </h3>
            <p className="font-sans text-lg">
              Unfortunately, most of the toys manufactured in the past 40 years
              have contained lots of plastic. Many of which do not degrade and
              end up in landfill. It is estimated that over 8 million working
              toys enter landfill every year in the Israel. Our aim is to take
              these unwanted toys and give them a new home and to avoid
              landfill. In the rare circumstance where a toy cannot be resold or
              donated, we strip it for spare parts to help repair other toys and
              dispose of the remaining parts responsibly.
